## What we do

Marine Hybrid Solutions works on developing the ship systems of the future. To fully benefit from Big Data in shipping, the systems on board must be more integrated and have structured data, regardless of which systems they come from. Our vision is that all data on board ships can be accessed both from on-board systems and from land.
